"I begin with the assumption that suffering and death from lack of food, shelter, and medical care are bad. I think most people will agree about this, although one may reach the same view by different routes. I shall not argue for this view. People can hold all sorts of eccentric positions, and perhaps from some of them it would not follow that death by starvation is in itself bad. It is difficult, perhaps impossible, to refute such positions, and so for brevity I will henceforth take this assumption as accepted (Singer, 1972).",Premise,Conclusion,Evidence,Counter-Example,0,"This text is a premise. Singer is making an initial assumption about what is ""bad"" in his ethical argument, and he does not seek to prove this assumption. "
"It follows from what I have said earlier that we ought to give money away, rather than spend it on clothes which we do not need to keep us warm. To do so is not charitable or generous. Nor is it the kind of act which philosophers and theologians have called ""supererogatory"" - an act which it would be good to do, but not wrong not to do. On the contrary, we ought to give the money away, and it is wrong not to do so (Singer, 1972).",Premise,Conclusion,Evidence,Counter-Example,1,"This excerpt is a conclusion that Singer is giving  at the end of his argument, following up on his claim that ""if it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it"" (Singer, 231)."
"It makes no moral difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away (Singer, 1972).",Premise,Conclusion,Evidence,Counter-Example,2,"Singer introduces his famous ""drowning child"" thought experiement, which is used as a piece of evidence supporting his argument. "
"I assume we all believe that bats have experience. After all, they are mammals, and there is no more doubt that they have experience than that mice or pigeons or whales have experience (Nagel, 1974).",Premise,Conclusion,Evidence,Counter-Example,0,Nagel's premise is that bats' do indeed have a form of experience. By taking this as a premise he choses not to argue for any epistemic claims about whether animals truly exist or if their thoughts truly exist.  
"I want to know what it is like for a bat to be a bat. Yet if I try to imagine this, I am restricted to the resources of my own mind, and those re- sources are inadequate to the task. I cannot perform it either by imagining additions to my present experience, or by imagining segments gradually subtracted from it, or by imagining some combination of additions, subtractions, and modifications (Nagel, 1974).",Premise,Conclusion,Evidence,Counter-Example,2,"This is a example of providing evidence because Nagel is using the example of imagining a bat to support his wider claim that consiousness has a subjective aspect that can only be understood through experience, and not through only description. "
"If we construe the reference of mental terms to physical events on the usual model, we either get a reappearance of separate subjective events as the effects through which mental reference to physical events is secured, or else we get a false account of how mental terms refer (Nagel, 1974).",Premise,Conclusion,Evidence,Counter-Example,1,"This is a conclusion because Nagel is summarizing the result of his argument. He is stating that an understanding of conciousness in the mind cannot be completely deduced from physical events, due to the issue of subjectivity in any expereince which can only be understood by experiencing a physical event personally. "
" Donald Davidson has argued that if mental events have physical causes and effects, they must have physical de- scriptions. He holds that we have reason to believe this even though we do not-and in fact could not-have a general psychophysical theory. His argument applies to intentional mental events, but I think we also have some reason to believe that sensations are physical processes, without being in a position to understand how (Nagel, 1974).",Premise,Conclusion,Evidence,Counter-Example,3,"Here, Nagel is responding to an alternative theory from Davidson. Hence, this passage is an instance of a counter-example."
